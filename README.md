# Libft
The aim of this project is to code a C library regrouping usual functions that
you’ll be allowed to use in all your other projects. [1337 school (42 network) project](./en.subject.pdf)

> ## _**Description**_
C programming can be very tedious when one doesn’t have access to those highly useful
standard functions. This project gives you the opportunity to re-write those functions,
understand them, and learn to use them. This library will help you for all your future C
projects.

|ft_toupper | Consult the man for the description of the function |
|ft_tolower | Consult the man for the description of the function |
|ft_calloc | Consult the man for the description of the function |
|ft_strdup | Consult the man for the description of the function |
|ft_substr | Allocates (with malloc(3)) and returns a substring from the string ’s’. The substring begins at index ’start’ and is of maximum size ’len’ |
|ft_strjoin | Allocates (with malloc(3)) and returns a new string, which is the result of the concatenation of ’s1’ and ’s2’ |
|ft_strtrim | Allocates (with malloc(3)) and returns a copy of ’s1’ with the characters specified in ’set’ removed from the beginning and the end of the string |
|ft_split | Allocates (with malloc(3)) and returns an array of strings obtained by splitting ’s’ using the character ’c’ as a delimiter. The array must be ended by a NULL pointer |
|ft_itoa | Allocates (with malloc(3)) and returns a string representing the integer received as an argument. Negative numbers must be handled |
|ft_strmapi | Applies the function ’f’ to each character of the string ’s’ to create a new string (with malloc(3)) resulting from successive applications of ’f’ |
|ft_putchar_fd | Outputs the character ’c’ to the given file descriptor |
|ft_putstr_fd | Outputs the string ’s’ to the given file descriptor |
|ft_putendl_fd | Outputs the string ’s’ to the given file descriptor, followed by a newline |
|ft_putnbr_fd | Outputs the integer ’n’ to the given file descriptor |
